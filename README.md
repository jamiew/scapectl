This is an unofficial app made for my own purposes, freely shared without any guarantees. I am not affiliated with or endorsed by Fractal Design in any way. The USB communication protocol was observed and documented from Fractal's [Adjust Pro](https://adjust.fractal-design.com) web app.

## Install

### Prebuilt downloads

Grab the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/charlietran/scapectl/releases). If you wish to compile yourself, see [Building from source](#building-from-source)

### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew tap charlietran/scapectl https://github.com/charlietran/scapectl
brew install --cask scapectl
```

Installs `/Applications/ScapeCtl.app` and symlinks the `scapectl` CLI onto your Homebrew path. The cask's `postflight` strips quarantine attributes and re-signs the app locally, so you can skip the manual `xattr` step in [Security and Privacy](#macos).

To uninstall (the `--zap` flag also removes config files in `~/Library/Application Support/scapectl`):

```sh
brew uninstall --cask --zap scapectl
```


## Security and Privacy

This app is **not macOS notarized** and **not Windows signed**. Your OS will flag it as untrusted on first run. If this raises one or both of your eyebrows, it should! Stop running random programs from strangers on the internet! But this is a hobby project and I'm not going to bother paying for Apple and Microsoft developer accounts.

This app does not contain any telemetry or otherwise make network calls in the background. It does make a network request to check for the latest version if you click on the "Check for update" menu item.

### macOS

macOS will block the app with _"ScapeCtl is damaged and can't be opened"_ or _"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"_. If you installed via [Homebrew](#homebrew-macos), the cask handles this automatically. Otherwise, remove the quarantine attribute manually:

```bash
xattr -cr ScapeCtl.app
```

macOS also requires explicit permission for the app to read USB data from the headphones. On first run you may see a "not permitted" error. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Input Monitoring**, click **+**, add the ScapeCtl app, and toggle it **on**.

### Windows

Windows will show a **"Windows protected your PC"** SmartScreen warning. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**.

### Linux

A udev Required for non-root HID access:

```bash
make udev
# OR manually:
sudo cp 50-fractal.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Usage

The app is meant to be simple menu interface for seeing the status of the headphones and easily toggling some of its features. You may also configure it to run scripts upon certain events, to automate things like switching the audio device when the headphones are docked and undocked.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> scapectl cannot be used at the same time as Fractal's [Adjust Pro](https://adjust.fractal-design.com) web app. Both talk to the dongle over the same USB HID stream and will fight over responses, leaving both in an inconsistent state. Close the Adjust Pro tab (and quit its offline Electron app if you have it) before launching scapectl, and likewise close scapectl first if you need to use the Adjust Pro web app.

## Configuration

Config file location:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/scapectl/config.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/scapectl/config.toml`

A default config with comments is created on first run. See `config.example.toml` for all options.

## Triggers

Run scripts automatically on device events. Enable "Trigger Scripts" in the menu, and add `[[triggers]]` entries to your config file (see `config.example.toml` for all options).

### Notifications

**macOS:**

```toml
[[triggers]]
event   = "HeadsetPowerOn"
script  = "osascript -e 'display notification \"Headset connected\" with title \"Scape\"'"
enabled = true

[[triggers]]
event   = "HeadsetPowerOff"
script  = "osascript -e 'display notification \"Headset disconnected\" with title \"Scape\"'"
enabled = true
```

**Windows** — uses `notify.ps1`, a small PowerShell script shipped alongside `scapectl.exe`:

```toml
[[triggers]]
event   = "HeadsetPowerOn"
script  = 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%SCAPE_DIR%\notify.ps1" -Message "Headset connected"'
enabled = true

[[triggers]]
event   = "HeadsetPowerOff"
script  = 'powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%SCAPE_DIR%\notify.ps1" -Message "Headset disconnected"'
enabled = true
```

### Audio Switching

The app cannot switch audio devices for you, but the trigger functiona allows you to execute any script you like. Here are config examples for how to automatically switch your default audio output when the headset powers on/off, with separate command-line audio switching tools:

> **Note:** Trigger scripts run without a login shell, so tools may not be on `PATH`. Use the full path to the executable in your trigger scripts. Run `which SwitchAudioSource` (macOS) or `where nircmd` (Windows) to find it.

**macOS** — install [SwitchAudioSource](https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx):

```bash
brew install switchaudio-osx
which SwitchAudioSource  # e.g. /opt/homebrew/bin/SwitchAudioSource
SwitchAudioSource -a     # list available devices
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The full path to SwitchAudioSource may differ on your system, run `which SwitchAudioSource` to see your actual path

```toml
[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOn"
script   = "/opt/homebrew/bin/SwitchAudioSource -s 'Fractal Design Scape'"
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5

[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOff"
script   = "/opt/homebrew/bin/SwitchAudioSource -s 'MacBook Pro Speakers'"
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5
```

**Windows** — download [NirCmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) (free, single `.exe`, no install required). Place it somewhere permanent and use the full path:

> [!NOTE]  
> Replace `C:\Tools\nircmd.exe` below with the actual location of where you put nircmd.exe

```toml
[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOn"
script   = 'C:\Tools\nircmd.exe setdefaultsounddevice "Fractal Design Scape" 1'
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5

[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOff"
script   = 'C:\Tools\nircmd.exe setdefaultsounddevice "Speakers" 1'
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5
```

**Linux** — uses `pactl` (PulseAudio) or `wpctl` (PipeWire), usually pre-installed:

```bash
pactl list short sinks   # list devices (PulseAudio)
wpctl status             # list devices (PipeWire)
```

```toml
[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOn"
script   = "pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-Fractal_Design_Scape"
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5

[[triggers]]
event    = "HeadsetPowerOff"
script   = "pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo"
enabled  = true
cooldown = 5
```

> Replace device names in the examples above with your actual device names.

### Trigger fields

| Field      | Required | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`    | Yes      | Event name (see table below)                                                                                                           |
| `script`   | Yes      | Shell command to run                                                                                                                   |
| `enabled`  | Yes      | `true` or `false`                                                                                                                      |
| `cooldown` | No       | Minimum seconds between firings (default: 0). Prevents a rule from running repeatedly if the event fires in quick succession. Tracked per event, so two events can share one script without sharing a cooldown. |
| `battery`  | No       | For `BatteryLevel` only: fire when battery <= this % (default: 20)                                                                     |

### Available events

### Environment variables

Scripts receive these environment variables:

| Variable          | Example                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `SCAPE_EVENT`     | `HeadsetPowerOn`                     |
| `SCAPE_DEVICE`    | `Fractal Scape Dongle`               |
| `SCAPE_VID`       | `36bc`                               |
| `SCAPE_PID`       | `0001`                               |
| `SCAPE_PATH`      | `DevSrvsID:4295080900`               |
| `SCAPE_TIMESTAMP` | `2026-03-21T14:30:00-07:00`          |
| `SCAPE_JSON`      | Full event as JSON                   |
| `SCAPE_BATTERY`   | Battery % (BatteryLevel events only) |
| `SCAPE_DIR`       | Directory containing the scapectl executable |

### CLI

You may optionally use the CLI for your own scripting or tinkering. Running `scapectl` with no arguments launches the system tray app. Pass a subcommand for CLI mode:

```bash
scapectl status       # Print battery, firmware, EQ slot, mic, connection info
scapectl devices      # List connected Fractal HID devices
scapectl sniff        # Continuously print incoming HID data
scapectl raw 02 f1 21 # Send arbitrary HID bytes
```

On **macOS**, the binary is inside the app bundle. You can run CLI commands from it directly:

```bash
ScapeCtl.app/Contents/MacOS/scapectl status
```

On **Windows** and **Linux**, run the binary directly:

```bash
# Windows
scapectl.exe status

# Linux
./scapectl status
```

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlietran/scapectl
cd scapectl
make build
./scapectl
```

Requires **Go 1.22+**. No other system dependencies on any platform.

### Cross-compilation

All builds are pure Go (no CGO). You can cross-compile for all 3 platforms from any of them.

## USB HID Protocol Reference

This section is a reference for anyone who wants to interact with the Fractal Scape headset via USB. Reverse-engineered from WebHID sniffer captures and the Fractal Adjust Pro Electron app source.

### Reverse Engineering Tools

- `tools/webhid_sniffer.js` — Paste into Chrome DevTools on adjust.fractal-design.com to capture all HID traffic with annotations

### Device Identifiers

| Device                | VID      | PID      | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Fractal Scape Dongle  | `0x36BC` | `0x0001` | 2.4 GHz USB wireless receiver          |
| Fractal Scape (wired) | `0x36BC` | TBD      | USB-C direct connection                |
| Adjust Pro Hub        | `0x36BC` | `0x1001` | Fan/RGB controller (different product) |

### HID Transport

- **Report ID**: 2 (all commands use report ID 2)
- **Payload size**: 63 bytes (report ID excluded)
- **Transport**: Output reports (`sendReport`, not feature reports)
- **Collection**: usagePage `0xFF00`, usage 1 (vendor-specific, collection index 3)
- **Response pattern**: all responses echo the first 2 command bytes

The dongle exposes 4 HID collections. Only collection 3 (usagePage `0xFF00`) is used for the control protocol. The others are Consumer Control (media keys), vendor `0xFF13` (unknown), and Telephony (call buttons). On macOS, the IOHIDManager must be opened with a matching dictionary restricted to the Fractal vendor ID to avoid triggering the Input Monitoring permission prompt (the Consumer Control collection looks like a keyboard to macOS).

### Architecture: Dongle vs Headset

The dongle acts as a wireless relay. Commands prefixed `0x11` are handled by the dongle directly (instant response). Commands prefixed `0xF1` are relayed to the headset (slower, ~60ms round-trip when online, times out when headset is off).

The Adjust Pro web app treats these as two separate "devices" internally:

- **Dongle controller** (`DEVICE_TYPE_FACTORY_DONGLE = 0x11`): queries dongle state
- **Headset delegate** (`DEVICE_TYPE_FACTORY_HEADSET = 0xF1`): queries headset status, controls EQ/mic/lighting

### Command Reference

#### 0x11 — Dongle Commands

| Command | Description             | Response                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `11 01` | Dongle firmware version | `11 01 00 <major> <minor>`                 |
| `11 02` | Dongle serial number    | `11 02 00 <ASCII string, null-terminated>` |
| `11 21` | Dongle state poll       | `11 21 00 <headset_present> ...`           |

> **Note:** `11 21` byte 3 (`headset_present`) is unreliable — it flaps in a cycle tied to the dongle's 2.4 GHz radio polling. Do not use it for presence detection. Use `f1 21` byte 18 instead.

#### 0xF1 — Headset Commands

| Command       | Description              | Response                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `f1 01`       | Headset firmware version | `f1 01 00 <major> <minor>`                 |
| `f1 02`       | Headset serial number    | `f1 02 00 <ASCII string, null-terminated>` |
| `f1 05`       | Headset info             | `f1 05 <data...>`                          |
| `f1 21`       | Full status poll         | 63-byte status blob (see below)            |
| `f1 34 XX YY` | Sidetone control         | `XX`=action, `YY`=steps (see below)        |
| `f1 36 01`    | Enable MNC               | Mic Noise Cancellation on                  |
| `f1 36 00`    | Disable MNC              | Mic Noise Cancellation off                 |

**Sidetone (`f1 34`):**

| Action byte | Meaning  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| `0x00`      | Disable  |
| `0x01`      | Enable   |
| `0x02`      | Vol up   |
| `0x03`      | Vol down |

Volume is relative (step-based), max 75 steps. Values >50 must be split across multiple commands. A status poll (`f1 21`) must be sent between each `f1 34` command — without it, the dongle acknowledges locally but does not relay to the headset.

**`f1 21` Status Blob:**

| Byte  | Field            | Values                                |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 0-1   | Echo             | `f1 21`                               |
| 2     | Status           | 0 = OK                                |
| 3     | Boom mic         | 0 = detached, nonzero = attached      |
| 4     | Muted            | 0 = unmuted, nonzero = muted          |
| 5     | EQ slot          | 1-3                                   |
| 6     | Lighting slot    | 0 = off, 1+ = active                  |
| 7-8   | Chat volume      |                                       |
| 9-10  | Game volume      |                                       |
| 11    | Volume state     |                                       |
| 12    | BT mode          |                                       |
| 13    | Hall sensor      | Boom mic position sensor              |
| 14    | Battery          | 0-100 (%)                             |
| 15    | Sidetone state   | 1 = on                                |
| 16-17 | Sidetone vol     |                                       |
| 18    | BT connection    | 1 = connected (reliable for presence) |
| 19    | MNC (ENC)        | 1 = on                                |
| 20    | Power state      | 1 = on                                |
| 33    | Dynamic lighting |                                       |
| 40    | WDL opt-in       | Windows Dynamic Lighting              |

> **Note on byte 3/4:** The Electron app source labels these as `hasBoomMic` and `isMuted` with inverted semantics (0 = attached, 0 = muted). In practice the actual device behavior matches the table above. The code handles this correctly — test with your device if in doubt.

#### 0xA4 — Config Transfer & Lighting

| Command               | Description                           |

**EQ Architecture:**

- 3 preset slots, each with up to 5 parametric EQ bands
- Each band: frequency (Hz), Q factor, gain (dB), filter type
- Filter types: 0 = peaking, 1 = low shelf, 2 = high shelf
- Biquad coefficients (IIR second-order sections) are pre-computed per sampling rate
- Driver IDs: 1, 2, 4 (corresponding to different audio paths/sample rates)
- Coefficients per band: `EqCoefA = [a1, a2]`, `EqCoefB = [b0, b1, b2]`
- Switching EQ slots re-uploads all coefficients — `a7 07 <slot>` selects which slot is active

**EQ Code Format** (shareable preset strings from the web app):

- Base64-encoded binary: `[version=1][numPoints][15 bytes per band][XOR checksum]`
- Per band (15 bytes): `[filterType:u8][gain:f32 LE][Q:f32 LE][freq:u16 LE][4 bytes padding]`
- Checksum: XOR of all preceding bytes

### Polling & Connection Detection

scapectl keeps a persistent HID connection to the dongle and polls `f1 21` every 1.5s with a 500ms timeout. It also sends `a4 0e 99` keepalive after each successful status poll.

**Connection detection** uses `f1 21` byte 18 (`btConnState`) exclusively:

- **Headset online:** `f1 21` returns within ~60ms, byte 18 = 1
- **Headset offline:** `f1 21` times out (500ms) — returned as disconnected status, not an error
- **Dongle unplugged:** HID I/O error closes the connection; next tick re-enumerates the USB bus

The dongle also sends unsolicited `11 21` reports. The `SendAndReceive` function filters by echo bytes (first 2 bytes of the response) to match the correct reply, discarding any unsolicited reports.

> **Why not use `11 21` for presence?** The Adjust Pro web app uses `11 21` byte 3 as a fast presence check before creating a headset delegate. But byte 3 is unreliable — it flaps tied to the dongle's 2.4 GHz radio polling cycle. scapectl skips `11 21` entirely and relies on `f1 21` byte 18. The tradeoff is slightly slower disconnect detection (~5s for the dongle's internal relay timeout vs instant) but zero false positives.
